What is scribe??
Scribe  is a open platform for enthusiast creators
It is an open source platform integrated in blockchain where an author can enjoy our secure nodes for publishing and being an editor node.
Basically, scribe is a web app built on react and django as front and backend along with the integration of blockchain. A registered author can publish their contents with ease and registered users can buy the contents. Along with that various publications(Gold, Silver, Bronze) are integrated with the use of NFTs with different prize tags. Ownership of a certain publication are further transferable to other users, again giving the authors extra credit for every transaction made. It's all about supporting Authors, Content writers and article publishers.

As already stated, the publishers are becoming cringe supporting superior or favoritism contents. So our app will be the real change for supporting the real content without even knowing the name of publishers. All we want is the basic details of the authors and the abstract of their content which are verified by our authenticated nodes which are no one but our previous authors who received a benchmarked points to be an authenticated node. So we believe in creating a non biased app for every content creator/lover.

For every contents(books, novels, articles) buyed by registered users, Authors will receive 88% of the total royalty price whereas the remaining 12% of the total sold will be in scribe’s pocket. Further as ownership of certain publications are transferable, on each transfer certain royalty will be given to the authors whereas certain charge will be cut from the receivable to gain us some more on each nft transactions. We are looking forward to getting $555 from KU hackfest.
